First Entry Series - Nutrition Label v.1
More practice with html/css with a sample nutrition label. 

intended updates to this project:
  1. linking words on label to corresponding definitions on a dictionary site or a wiki page.
  2. move the label to the right for some space for an image on the left (this might ultimately be an asset for a bigger project I had in mind down the road)
