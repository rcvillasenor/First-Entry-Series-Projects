First Entry Series (FES) - Website Main Page Demo

Simple website main page web project to practice with html, css, and js.

A step above a previous project (Login Form).

Functionality will include a "main web page" of sorts that has a login feature using a wrapper and some animations to rotate between login "states".

This is also my first step into multi-page site design as well as managing the resources required to run the pseudo-site (see repository contents and design schema).
Note: This project could also be scaled up/built upon.
